We will build a network of Pyramidal cell and OLM (Somatostatin positive) interneurons from CA3 to study how mutual inhibition among the dendrite-targeting interneurons can potentially channel the flow of information in a recurrent network. All the codes for neurons were taken from a CA3 network model due to [Sanjay et. al, 2015](https://modeldb.science/186768). The logic for network connectivity were inspired from [Roberts et al, 2014](https://modeldb.science/238332).
